    "Ordinal: An ordinal variable has a clear ordering within its categories. For example, consider temperature as a variable with three distinct (but related) categories (low, medium, high). Another example is an education degree (Ph.D., Master’s, or Bachelor’s)."

    "1. One Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",

    "In one Hot Encoding method, each category value is converted into a new column and assigned a value as 1 or 0 to the column.\n",

In this technique, the author made a slight modification to the One hot encoding technique that is instead of creating the new column for every category, they limit creating the new column for 10 most frequent categories.
