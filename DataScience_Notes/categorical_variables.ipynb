    "Nomial: A nominal variable has no intrinsic ordering to its categories. For example, gender is a categorical variable having two categories (Male and Female) with no inherent ordering between them. Another example is Country (India, Australia, America, and so forth).\n",

    "Ordinal: An ordinal variable has a clear ordering within its categories. For example, consider temperature as a variable with three distinct (but related) categories (low, medium, high). Another example is an education degree (Ph.D., Master’s, or Bachelor’s)."

    "\n",
    "This technique is applied for nomial categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one Hot Encoding method, each category value is converted into a new column and assigned a value as 1 or 0 to the column.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "· Simple to use and fits well for data with few categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",

In this technique, the author made a slight modification to the One hot encoding technique that is instead of creating the new column for every category, they limit creating the new column for 10 most frequent categories. Sounds like a Jargon !!!! Me too 😊\n",

    "Steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Using the categorical variable, evaluate the probability of the Target variable (where the output is True or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Calculate the probability of the Target variable having a False or 0 output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Calculate the probability ratio i.e. P(True or 1) / P(False or 0).\n",
